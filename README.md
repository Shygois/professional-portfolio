Description:

Created a portfolio page that includes my projects, my interets, and how to contact me.

Included three projects in my work portfolio section. Run-buddy page, horiseon marketing, and my github profile with access to my current repos. All images are labeled and clickable and will take you to the deployed page to review my work. 

In my interests section I talked about my love for travel and made sure to include a link to my instagram travel page. You can access my travel page through the image as well as the card button. 

Contact me section was giving me a bit of trouble. I wasn't able to get my image and text close enough together for some reason so there's an awkward gap when you view that section. If I kept the image at 100% then it bridged the gap but the image was huge. It looked fine with the image at 100% on mobile but when viewing on a desktop the picture was just way too big so I reduced the image size to 50% which created the weird gap. I need to look into this some more and see how to resolve. 

I used bootstrap style sheet and their bundle sheet to help me achieve what I wanted in a faster and more efficent way. I added viewports and media queries to make sure my page looked good from all screens types.
